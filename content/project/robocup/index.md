During my master's program at TUM, I participated in a team project focused on developing a service robot to serve drinks. The robot was designed to go to the service point, listen to people's requests (i.e., which drink they wanted), then navigate to a shelf, recognize the requested drink, retrieve it, and bring it back to the customer.

This project encompassed several key areas of knowledge, including:

* Speech recognition
* Navigation using SLAM
* Object identification and neural network training with YOLO
* Robot manipulation using MoveIt
