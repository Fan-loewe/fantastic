In my master's program at TUM, I contributed to a team project involving a soccer robot. The goal was to develop a system where the robot detects the goalkeeper and determines the optimal angle to shoot the soccer ball past the goalkeeper.

This project involved key areas of knowledge:

* **Computer Vision:** Utilizing OpenCV for object detection, specifically identifying the goalkeeper.
* **Machine Learning:** Implementing reinforcement learning techniques to determine the best shooting angle for successfully navigating past the goalkeeper.
