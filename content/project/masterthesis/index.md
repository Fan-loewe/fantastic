In my master's thesis project at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch), ETH Zurich, I focused on:

1. **Isovist Generation**:
   * Create isovists using edge detection.
   * Incorporate big data analysis for accuracy.
   * Implement dynamic navigation with real-time GPS.
2. **Human Pose Estimation**:
   * Optimize human pose estimation for embedded systems.
   * Use Nvidia Jetson and TensorRT for real-time performance.
3. **Risk Maps Generation**:
   * Estimate traffic accident probabilities based on detected pedestrain density.
   * Generate risk maps for urban safety based on estimated traffic accidents.

This project leveraged advanced computer vision, embedded systems, and data analysis to enhance urban navigation and safety.
