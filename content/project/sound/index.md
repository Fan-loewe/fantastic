In my master's program at TUM, I developed a system for a robot to localize sound sources and rotate its head accordingly. Using two microphones to simulate ears, I captured audio, converted analog signals to digital, and implemented algorithms for sound localization. I then generated PWM signals to control the actuators for precise motor control.

This project encompassed key areas of knowledge:

* **Low-level Programming:** Hardware control in assembly language.
* **Microcontroller Programming:** Real-time management of sensors and actuators.
* **Signal Processing:** ADC and sound localization.
* **Control Systems:** PWM signal generation for motor control.
